"""The version of the game the tools work on, and where its files are.

VERSION comes from the environment, as the Makefile exports it (make
VERSION=eu), and defaults to us like the Makefile. Each version has its
settings in mk/version/<version>.mk (the executable's name and the disc),
its splat configs, symbols and checksums in config/<version>/; splat writes
its disassembly to asm/<version>/, the build goes to build/<version>/ and
objdiff's target objects to expected/<version>/.
