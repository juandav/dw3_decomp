"""Name, in another version (eu), the symbols a shared C file uses.

    tools/version_symbols.py <version> src/<binary>/<module>.c ... [--write]

A module that becomes C in a version links against the names its C uses:
every function and datum it calls or reads must have its name in that
version's symbol files, at that version's address. This reads them from the
module's object (build/<version>/src/<module>.c.o, so build it first: make
VERSION=<version> build/<version>/src/<module>.c.o, with the module a c
segment in the version's config and listed in its .mk) and from the
original: each relocation of the object (a jal, a %hi/%lo pair, a pointer in
its data) sits where the original has the same instruction or word, which
holds the version's address. The names the object defines itself get the
address of their section, where the version's config puts the module. A
string or table that only the module's data points to gets splat's
automatic name (D_80012345) in the binary's own symbol file, as us has
them, so that splat labels it and the report pairs the pointers. A datum
the C defines or uses under us's automatic name gets it at the version's
address too, unless the version's asm has that name at another address
(then the module can't be shared until the name is a real one). And a field
of the C's data that a module still in asm reads by splat's name
(D_80012345) gets its address in undefined_syms, for the link.

The functions and rodata the C still includes as asm (INCLUDE_ASM,
INCLUDE_RODATA) need their name before the object builds: splat writes the
file the C includes under it. A named one has it already
(tools/match_versions.py --seed); one with us's automatic name
(func_80012345, D_80012345) gets it at the address of its confident pair in
build/<version>/version_pairs.tsv (tools/match_versions.py), or, when the
module's code or rodata is as long as us's, at the same offset in it; in the
binary's own file. So a module takes two runs: one to name those, then make
VERSION=<version> generate and the object, and one for the rest.

A name goes in the version's files that have it in us (config/<v>/symbols.txt,
symbols_<overlay>.txt, stages/<stage>.txt or undefined_syms.txt), with us's
comment. A name an overlay's C defines that us has only in the executable
(code the version links into the overlay) goes in the overlay's file, marked
"us-main" for tools/check_names.py. It prints what it would add, and the
names whose reads disagree or whose address the version's files already
give another name; --write adds the rest. Then make VERSION=<version>
regenerate and compare: a relocation in a function that doesn't line up
with the original reads the wrong word (the reads of one name have to
agree, which catches most).
