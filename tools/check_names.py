"""Check that every version names its symbols as us does.

The versions share their names: a name in eu's symbol files means the same
function or datum as that name in us's. The symbol files are the mapping
between versions: tools/match_versions.py --seed writes the us names of the
functions it pairs, and nothing else needs keeping. So a name of another
version must still be one of us's:

- in us's file of the same binary: config/us/symbols.txt for the
  executable, symbols_<overlay>.txt for an overlay, stages/<stage>.txt for
  a stage overlay;
- a function there if it is a function here (type:func), data if data.

A rename made in us only (or in one version only) leaves the old name
behind somewhere, and this fails; tools/rename.py renames in every version.
Not checked: splat's automatic names (func_80012345, D_80012345), names in a
binary us doesn't have (one of eu's own stage overlays), and a name that is
a version's own, with "version-only" in its comment:

    func_name = 0x80012345; // type:func version-only

A version that has, in one binary, code that us has in another names it with
us's name and "us-<binary>" in the comment ("us-main" for us's executable,
"us-cardgame" for an overlay, "us-wstag200" for a stage); that name is
checked against that binary's names in us instead:

    drawWindow = 0x800A5123; // type:func us-main
