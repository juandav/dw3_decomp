"""Split another version's binaries (eu) into us's modules.

    tools/split_version.py <version> [binary ...]

A version that is still splat's assembly has each binary as a few big asm
ranges (its rodata, its code, its data, its bss). This rewrites the
subsegments of config/<version>/<binary>.yaml (the executable and every
overlay us has, or those given) so that they follow us's modules: one asm
segment per us module, with us's name, and the rodata, data and bss
segments each module owns, so that splat writes the version's assembly to
the same paths under asm/<version>/ as us's. Each module is then a unit of
the report under the same name as in us, and it becomes C by turning its
segments into c, .rodata, .data and .bss and listing the file in
mk/version/<version>.mk. The stages need nothing: each one is one module,
named as in us by tools/stage_yaml.py.

Where each module starts in the version:

- code: at its first function. The functions are those of
  build/<version>/version_pairs.tsv (tools/match_versions.py <version>); a
  function the version has and us doesn't goes with the one before it. The
  modules follow the version's order, which can differ from us's;
- rodata, data and bss: each data segment of us is placed where the references
  agree: a function paired with a us one reads, at about the same place in
  it, the same datum, so the version's address of each datum the pair reads
  votes for where the segment starts. The votes that keep the shift of the
  segment before win. A segment no paired function reads goes where its
  bytes are most alike, near where us has it.

A segment the version's config already has (by name: the psyq ranges, or
modules split before) keeps its start, so running it again changes
nothing, and a module that is C in the version's config stays C.
Hand-written assembly (us's hasm segments) is asm here, and two segments
of one name become one. A data-only module (the executable's data/game.c)
has no code segment while it is asm: splat writes nothing for an asm
segment of no size; when it becomes C, add its `c` segment where the code
ends, as in us. The rest of the config is kept.

It needs us and the version built (make VERSION=<v>: splat's asm in
asm/<v>/ and the ELFs) and the pairs, and it prints, per binary, what it
placed by bytes and the sizes that differ from us's. Then make
VERSION=<version> regenerate and compare. A boundary in the wrong place
still builds the same binary while the module is asm, so check a module's
boundaries when it becomes C.
