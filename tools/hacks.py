"""Count the workarounds the matched C needs, by the markers they carry, and
fail on what the source must never have.

    tools/hacks.py                  the counts; fails on forbidden code
    tools/hacks.py --list           every one, with its file, line and function
    tools/hacks.py --check README.md
                                    also fail if README.md's badge or table differs

Every spot where the C only matches through a form natural C wouldn't take
carries a comment that says so. This finds them in src/ and include/:

- fake matches: a comment that starts with "fake match:", the last resort,
  a form forced only for the codegen;
- unused frame locals: a local the code never uses, kept because the
  original's stack frame has room for it, marked with exactly
  /* unused, but it is in the original stack frame */
- form-dependent matches: a comment that says "match depends on", where the
  match needs one of several equivalent forms (a statement macro's
  do-while, an extra block, braces left out, a copy of a variable, a type,
  one version's own form of a loop);
- functions still in assembly: INCLUDE_ASM lines.

The README's badge shows the fake matches, then the other two kinds
together. The functions still in assembly are counted apart, and --list also
shows what is assembly without being a hack: the rodata still behind
INCLUDE_RODATA, the hand-written .s files, the data written as top-level asm
(padding that the original objects have) and the macros that wrap inline asm
for what C can't say (moving $sp to the scratchpad, GTE instructions).

A function either matches as C or stays behind its INCLUDE_ASM, so these
always fail:

- NON_MATCHING (or NONMATCHING) code, and #if 0 blocks: C that doesn't
  match, or a draft, doesn't belong in src/;
- inline asm written in a function's body, a register variable pinned with
  asm("$reg"), or a top-level asm that isn't data: assembly in place of C.
