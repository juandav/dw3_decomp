/*
 * libgte MTX_06: ApplyMatrixSV.
 *
 * Hand-written assembly, not compiler output: it moves values in and out of
 * the GTE (ctc2, mtc2, mfc2 and its commands), which C can't express, keeps
 * to the $t registers and leaves delay slots that the PsyQ build (GCC 2.7.2
 * and ASPSX in reorder mode) would have filled.
